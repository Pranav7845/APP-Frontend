## Introduction and Inspiration

The medical care system in a developing nation like India is severely overburdened, with a doctor-to-patient ratio far below the World Health Organization's recommended standard. Emergency response times are often slow, particularly in rural areas, where the average response time can exceed 30 minutes. Doctors are overstressed, frequently dealing with an overwhelming influx of patients that prevents them from giving each patient the proper time and attention needed for effective care. According to a 2020 report, India had just one doctor for every 1,457 people, well below the WHO's recommendation of one doctor per 1,000 people.

I have personally experienced the shortcomings of this system. In a critical situation, the delayed emergency response and the rushed consultations made it evident that something needed to change. This experience inspired me to build Life Line, a solution aimed at improving emergency response times and providing preliminary medical assistance to alleviate the pressure on healthcare professionals. With AI based emergency dispatcher and an AI Doctor for diagnosis and preliminary assesment, Lifeline is a complete solution to provide healthcare to those who cant access it.
